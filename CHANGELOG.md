# Changelog

reviewqa's release-by-release history. v0.19 → v0.30 was the
taxonomy-closure arc that took the framework from a single-Playwright
happy-flow generator to a 10-layer deterministic test author. v0.55+
shipped the depth-parity arc (Contract, Integration, Mobile, A11y trio).
v0.61–v0.62 are the live-execution + composer-validation arc — first
real-site run + composer destination-DOM enforcement.

## v0.65 — reviewqa serve (Phase A: read-only project viewer)

New `reviewqa serve` subcommand. Opens a localhost HTTP server (default
`127.0.0.1:8765`) that loads an existing reviewqa-generated project and
renders a read-only browser UI for its Features, Scenarios, and
stakeholder docs. Auto-opens the user's default browser (skip with
`--no-browser`).

This is **Phase A** of the local-UI roadmap. Read-only — no mutations.
Phase B (Scenario CRUD), Phase C (locator suggestion from live DOM),
and Phase D (AI-composed step bindings from hand-written Gherkin) ship
as follow-up PRs.

- New package `internal/serve/` with hand-rolled Gherkin parser (no
  cucumber-go dependency), TypeScript step-defs regex parser, and an
  HTTP handler exposing `GET /api/project`, `GET /api/feature`,
  `GET /api/steps`, `GET /api/doc`. Localhost-only by request-origin
  enforcement; `--addr` overridable but the default is loopback.
- New `cmd/reviewqa/serve.go` wires the subcommand with `--workdir`,
  `--addr`, `--no-browser` flags.
- Frontend lives under `internal/serve/web/` and is embedded via
  `//go:embed`. Plain HTML + CSS + JS — no build step. CSS variables
  mirror the public site (copper / deep-water / ink + Sora / Inter /
  Fira Code) so the local UI looks native next to the marketing pages.
- Path-traversal defenses on `GET /api/feature` and `GET /api/doc`
  (rooted at workdir, `../` escape rejected with 400).
- 14 new tests in `internal/serve/` (Gherkin parser × 5, step-defs
  parser × 2, HTTP handler × 5, including path-traversal rejection).
- `cmd/reviewqa/main.go` version constant bumped 0.64 → 0.65.

Usage:
```bash
reviewqa serve --workdir ./examples/playwright-dev
```

## v0.64 — re-emit examples + drop version-caveat prose + AI badge

User feedback after v0.63: the "Output from the v0.59 binary — templates
remain current through v0.62" gymnastics was the wrong convention. The
website must show CURRENT output, not a multi-release explanation. The
"DGX" badge is vendor-specific; users may point `REVIEWQA_LLM` at any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. And the depth-parity / live-execution /
composer-DOM narration in docs.html belongs in this changelog, not in
the docs page.

- All six committed examples re-emitted against the v0.64 binary.
  Counts unchanged (183 / 196 / 186 / 201 / 197 / 46) — v0.61's four
  template fixes apply automatically; v0.62's composer DOM validation
  filters out the F-1 mismatches the previous emission carried.
- New `scripts/refresh-examples.sh` codifies the build + probe + split
  flow with the awk split-pattern baked in. Run before tagging every
  release. CI-safe for the 4 deterministic examples; the 2 AI-on ones
  need a local `REVIEWQA_LLM` endpoint.
- web/index.html + web/docs.html + README.md + examples/README.md
  prose simplified everywhere to "v0.64 binary" — no more multi-release
  caveats, no more "introduced in vX.Y, current in vZ.W" labels.
- "DGX" badge → "AI" badge on the spritecloud + petstore cards. The
  directory names `examples/*-dgx/` stay (stable URLs) but every other
  surface (prose, docs section title, env var docs, env-var examples)
  is vendor-agnostic.
- Three feature callouts removed from web/docs.html: "Depth parity
  (v0.55–v0.57)", "Live execution validated (v0.61)", "Composer
  destination-DOM validation (v0.62)". Their content lives here.
- `cmd/reviewqa/main.go` version constant bumped 0.63 → 0.64.

## v0.63 — repo-wide consistency sweep + force gh-pages redeploy

Live https://spritecloud.github.io/reviewqa/ was showing **v0.23-era**
content because the pages.yml workflow did not fire for the v0.60 merge
(missed-push window during the v0.60/v0.61/v0.62 cluster on 2026-06-17)
and v0.61/v0.62 did not touch web/. Net effect: the live site was two
arcs behind, and the repo's web/ source itself was at v0.59-era prose.

This release does not change any code. It:

- Brings web/index.html and web/docs.html up to v0.62. Hero badge
  bumped from v0.59 to v0.62. "What's new in v0.61 + v0.62" callout
  added above the examples grid. docs.html gains two new callouts
  (live execution validated; composer destination-DOM validation).
- Brings README.md and examples/README.md up to v0.62. The committed
  example output remains v0.59-emitted — that's labelled explicitly
  ("committed at v0.59; current binary v0.62"). The deterministic
  templates beneath the examples ARE current through v0.62.
- Backfills CHANGELOG.md with the v0.61 and v0.62 entries that were
  shipped without changelog notes.
- Bumps cmd/reviewqa/main.go's source-default version constant from
  "0.1.0" to "0.62" so a locally-built binary's --version output
  matches the release line (release.yml still ldflags-overrides this).
- Triggers pages.yml via `gh workflow run pages.yml` so the live
  site picks up the new content even if the path-filter misfires
  again.

## v0.62 — composer destination-DOM validation (F-1 fix)

Adds `composer.ValidateAgainst(scenarios, journey)` after the existing
pattern-syntax `Validate` in the propose pipeline. The new pass walks
each composed scenario tracking the "current page" as the journey
progresses through link clicks / direct navigations, then drops any
scenario whose H1 or title assertion conflicts with the destination
metadata recorded in `Journey.Pages`.

Match is loose (case-insensitive substring either direction) so
real human-quality assertions like `the main heading reads "About"`
still pass when the page H1 is `About us`. Pages with no recorded
metadata pass through — the validator is strictly additive, it only
ever drops scenarios it can prove wrong.

Closes the F-1 finding from the v0.61 spritecloud run (3 of 66
composed scenarios asserted destination H1 text the page does not
render). Future generations against any site will silently drop
these instead of shipping broken specs.

7 new tests in `internal/composer/composer_destination_test.go`.
Full suite 502/502 green.

## v0.61 — execute spritecloud-com-dgx locally + 4 template fixes

First time the generated suite was actually executed against a real
production site (https://www.spritecloud.com). Until v0.61 reviewqa
had been validated only at the **emission layer** — Go tests asserted
templates rendered correctly, file counts were right, Scenarios
contained the expected blocks. The execution surfaced four template
bugs that compile cleanly but fail at runtime, all now fixed:

- **T-1** — `pw_package.tmpl` pinned `playwright-bdd@^7.4.0` which
  resolves to 7.5.0; that version imports
  `playwright/lib/common/configLoader.js`, removed in playwright
  1.51+. Every test died at config load. Bumped to `^9.0.0`.
- **T-2** — `gen.go::annotateQualityReport` prepended a C-style
  block comment to `.feature` files; Gherkin only allows `#` line
  comments. Added `TmplPlaywrightFeature` to the exclusion switch.
- **T-3** — `pw_mobile.tmpl` put `test.use({...devices[name]})` inside
  `test.describe()`. Playwright forbids this ("forces a new
  worker"). Refactored to `browser.newContext({...devices[name]})`
  per test — same coverage, no `test.use()` violation.
- **T-4** — `pw_steps.tmpl::submit()` grabbed the first submit-like
  button on the page. On spritecloud.com that's the disabled footer
  newsletter "Subscribe" — `click()` hung for 30s waiting for it to
  enable. Rewrote to skip disabled buttons and prefer buttons inside
  filled forms.

Real spritecloud findings (S category) — kept as sentinel candidates,
not template bugs: 5 footer social-icon links with no accessible name
(WCAG 2.4.4, 4.1.2); /guides page has zero `<h1>` tags (WCAG 1.3.1);
color-contrast violations on the homepage; unlabeled form inputs.

LLM-design issues (F category) — 3 of 66 composed scenarios asserted
against destination-page H1 text not actually rendered. Addressed in
v0.62.

Numbers after all four fixes: 32/40 mobile pass (8 fails all on the
/guides h1 S finding), 67/71 Gherkin pass (3 F-1, 1 tab-order S),
25/25 stub specs cleanly skip.

Run report: `examples/spritecloud-com-dgx/_run/v0.61-run-report.md`.

## v0.60 — doc sweep + refresh all 6 examples

User audit: "the project sustain certain consistency. README, GitHub
Pages, Docs and all are updated? They have any cognitive dissonance?
Have we run the full reviewqa locally using the DGX for all the
examples?"

Two Explore agents confirmed the dissonance. README claimed v0.23,
web/index.html hero said "One Go binary. v0.23.", web/docs.html
example matrix carried stale v0.58 numbers, and the four non-DGX
example directories were last refreshed at v0.30 — missing every
v0.41+ template family (a11y trio, integration stubs, mobile matrix,
edge family, etc.).

No code logic changed. The sweep does three things:

1. **Refreshed all 6 example projects against the v0.59 binary**:
     playwright-dev          39 → 183 files
     gohugo-io               42 → 196 files
     books-toscrape-com      37 → 186 files
     es-wikipedia-org-madrid 51 → 201 files
     spritecloud-com-dgx     197 (refresh; 66 Scenarios, 34 @llm-composed)
     petstore-swagger-io-dgx 46 (refresh; 108 contract test blocks)

2. **Rewrote the stale README sections** into a single coherent v0.59
   voice: hero, quick-start (probe / prompt / generate / scan / heal /
   ledger update / run-once), 10-layer taxonomy table with depth column,
   subcommand reference, environment-variable tables (LLM / probe /
   CI / healing), workflow examples. Dropped per-version cruft from
   v0.21/v0.23/v0.24/v0.25 that no longer matched the binary.

3. **Aligned web/index.html + web/docs.html**: hero version v0.23 → v0.59,
   examples grid 4 cards → 6 (added petstore-DGX), docs.html §05 matrix
   numbers refreshed (118 → 197, 41 → 46), examples/README.md table
   rebuilt against the v0.59 file counts.

Verification:
  - grep -r "v0\.\(23\|30\|34\)" README.md web/index.html web/docs.html examples/README.md
    → only intentional history markers remain.
  - Each of the 6 example directories has tests/e2e/integration-{db,cache,
    obs,auth}/ subdirs (v0.57 templates) — confirms the refresh hit every dir.
  - 495 tests still passing.

## v0.59 — a11y trio uncapped + deepened (1+2+2 → 5+5+5)

Two gaps the post-v0.58 audit surfaced:

- **A11y emitted on only half the crawled pages.** The per-page
  companions loop was capped at `coverage.FuzzCap()` (5 in standard
  mode). On a 30-page spritecloud.com crawl only the first 5 pages
  got the a11y trio (a11y / landmarks / keyboard). The other 25 were
  blind spots — wrong for cheap companions like axe-core.
- **A11y sub-templates themselves were shallow.** `pw_a11y` shipped
  one axe smoke; `pw_a11y_landmarks` two structural checks; 
  `pw_keyboard_nav` two interaction checks.

`internal/probe/probe.go::qualityCompanions` now splits the per-page
loop into two passes — Pass A (uncapped) emits the a11y trio on every
crawled page; Pass B (capped) keeps the heavy companions (visual /
perf / mobile multi-device / etc.) within budget.

Each a11y template now ships 5 tests:

  pw_a11y.tmpl                1 → 5
    @smoke           axe WCAG 2a/2aa/21a/21aa — serious+critical = 0
    @wcag-aa         WCAG 2.1 AA-only profile for targeted CI gates
    @color-contrast  most-violated WCAG rule standalone
    @aria-attrs      ARIA-attribute discipline (cat.aria rules)
    @form-labels     every form input has a programmatic label

  pw_a11y_landmarks.tmpl      2 → 5
    @smoke               single main / h1 / ≥1 nav
    @no-aria-hidden      no focusables inside aria-hidden subtrees
    @heading-hierarchy   heading order is sequential (no h1→h3 skips)
    @landmark-names      duplicate landmarks have accessible names
    @skip-link           skip-to-content affordance (WCAG 2.4.1)

  pw_keyboard_nav.tmpl        2 → 5
    @smoke           Tab cycles through first 10 focusables
    @focus-indicator  every focusable has a visible focus indicator
    @escape-dismiss  Escape closes a dialog AND returns focus
    @enter-space     Enter activates focused links/buttons
    @no-trap         Tab past last focusable wraps or exits

Effect on spritecloud-com-dgx: a11y subdir went 25 → 100 files
(30 pages × 3 sub-templates × 5 tests = **450 a11y test blocks**).
The example refresh + docs depth column reflect the new floor.

## v0.55 → v0.58 — taxonomy depth parity

User audit: "we touched all of the categories but not in the same depth
… ensure consistent level/depth for each category." Three layers
shipped 1–2 tests per emission while API/UI/Non-functional shipped
5–15. This arc closes the gap.

- **v0.55 — Contract depth.** `pw_contract.tmpl` 1 → 9 tests per
  endpoint (8 adversarial: wrong-method, oversized-query, invalid-json,
  unicode, sqli, xss, null-byte, rapid-burst). `pw_graphql_stub.tmpl`
  1 → 6 (empty-query, malformed, type-mismatch, deep-nested,
  bare-GET). `pw_webhook_stub.tmpl` 1 → 6 (replay, expired timestamp,
  wrong algorithm, truncated signature, tampered body). Path-only —
  schema-aware semantic negatives deferred.
- **v0.56 — Mobile depth.** `pw_mobile.tmpl` now iterates 4 devices
  (iPhone 13, Pixel 5, iPad Pro 11, Galaxy S9+) × 2 orientations =
  8 effective tests per page. `pw_touch.tmpl` adds pinch-zoom,
  scroll-momentum, tap-then-rotate (5 gesture families total).
- **v0.57 — Integration depth.** Four new per-kind scaffold templates
  emit unconditionally per origin:
  `pw_integration_{db,cache,obs,auth}_stub.tmpl`, each with 3
  `test.skip()` blocks documenting the wire-up TODOs. Total: 5
  integration stubs per origin (the v0.43 catch-all + 4 new), 15
  skipped blocks per origin documenting concrete scenarios.
- **v0.58 — Examples refresh + docs.** spritecloud-com-dgx 118 → 122
  files (51 Scenarios, 16 `@llm-composed`); petstore-swagger-io-dgx
  41 → 44 files with **108 contract-layer test blocks** (12 endpoints
  × 9 tests each). `web/docs.html` taxonomy table gained a
  "tests per emit" column; two new FAQ entries cover the depth-parity
  story and how integration stubs activate.

## v0.40 — bug sentinels + v1.0.0-rc.2

- `pw_sentinel.tmpl` — every "open" row in `tests/e2e/docs/findings.md`
  becomes a `test.fail()` spec under `tests/e2e/sentinels/`. Stays red
  while the bug is unfixed; flips to "unexpected pass" the moment the
  fix lands.
- `internal/ledger/sentinels.go::EmitSentinels` drives the emission;
  `parseLedger` re-parses the markdown table in cmd/reviewqa so the
  generate path picks them up alongside compat tests + integration
  items.
- CHANGELOG.md consolidated v0.31 → v0.40 history.
- Tag `v1.0.0-rc.2` — the depth gap from the honest assessment is
  meaningfully closed (per-journey density doubled + parameterized
  Outlines + stateful variants + interaction-state visual + keyboard
  + landmarks). Rename to "quail" still postponed.

## v0.39 — interaction-state visual + a11y depth

Three new per-page quality companions:
- `pw_visual_states.tmpl` — default / hover / focus screenshots of the
  primary CTA
- `pw_keyboard_nav.tmpl` — Tab through 10 focusables, assert
  reachability + focus indicator
- `pw_a11y_landmarks.tmpl` — single main, single h1, ≥1 nav, no
  focusables inside aria-hidden

`qualityCompanions` extended with a per-kind `suffix` so templates
sharing a subdir (a11y/visual) don't collide on filename.

## v0.38 — stateful + cross-journey Scenarios

- `@state:logged-in` / `@state:anonymous` variants when suite has
  authenticate journey
- `@kind:cross-journey` when suite has convert journey
- `Catalogue` threaded into journey items for suite-level introspection

## v0.37 — parameterized Scenario Outlines

- One Scenario Outline + 3 example rows per text-like input type
  (email / password / tel / url / number / text)
- `paramRowsFor` registry of deterministic value sweeps

## v0.36 — per-journey scenario depth

5 new conditional Scenario family templates: retry, boundary,
tab-order, overflow, empty-state, resume, back-button. Per-journey
average density doubled (2.1 → 5.7).

## v0.35 — composer response cache

- `internal/composer/cache.go` file-backed memo keyed by `(model, URL,
  kind, title, h1, links, pages)`
- Re-runs against the same site return cached scenarios in 0s
- Strictly opt-in via `REVIEWQA_LLM_CACHE=auto` or explicit path

## v0.34 — multi-model ladder

- `composer.Ladder` walks rungs in order; first to parse cleanly wins
- `@model:<id>` tag on every emitted scenario
- `REVIEWQA_LLM_LADDER=<m1>,<m2>,...` env opts in

## v0.33 — composer feedback loop

- `composer.LoadFeedback` reads `findings.md`; failed test titles
  embedded in the LLM prompt as "DO NOT re-propose" list

## v0.32 — step pattern vocabulary expansion

12 new Gherkin step patterns each backed by a step definition:
URL contains, page has at least N items, scroll, menu open/close,
focus, dropdown select, key press, wait, response status, scroll
into view.

## v0.31 — composer robustness

- Dirty-JSON sanitizer strips trailing commas, smart quotes, doubled
  commas
- Single retry with stricter prompt on parse failure
- `Journey.Pages` per-link destination metadata fixes the cross-page
  h1 mismatch
- Cross-journey dedup via `ScenarioKey`

## v0.30 — polish + cleanup + v1.0-rc

- Cyclomatic complexity refactor: `gen.templateLocation` switch
  (cyclo 75) → O(1) registry map (cyclo 2). Out of the top-5
  hotspot list.
- Stale-PR sweep: closed every remaining `reviewqa: tests for PR #N`
  dogfood follow-up.
- CHANGELOG.md (this file) consolidates the v0.19 → v0.30 history.

## v0.29 — Layer 9 data quality

- `dbt_schema.tmpl` — per-column tests (unique + not_null) routed by
  identity-column heuristic
- `pandera_conformance.tmpl` — two-case validate test
- `great_expectations.tmpl` — expect_column_to_exist + not_null suite

## v0.28 — mobile reach

- `pw_mobile.tmpl` — iPhone 13 emulation + touch
- `pw_deeplink.tmpl` — per-declared deep-link path
- `rn_happyflow.tmpl` — Detox scaffold for React Native
- `flutter_happyflow.tmpl` — flutter_test scaffold

## v0.27 — Layer 5 integration tests

- `reviewqa.yml` config file at repo root
- `internal/integration` package: `Load` + `EmitItems`
- Templates for DB / broker / cache / storage / search / auth +
  shared `_containers.ts` and `docker-compose.test.yml`

## v0.26 — finish deferred auto-emission

- TS extractor: DTO interfaces, classes-with-constructors,
  Redux/Pinia/Zustand/Vuex stores
- `plan.fanOutAspects` routes IsDTO / FrameworkHint="class" /
  StoreKind to the matching aspect templates

## v0.25 — LLM-driven scenario composer (opt-in)

- `internal/composer` package: `Propose` returns validated
  `[]ExtraScenario` constrained to the registered step patterns
- `--llm <url>` flag on probe + prompt; strictly opt-in, local-only
  (DGX netbird-private; CI runs see no LLM step)
- `qwen3-coder-next:latest` default model
- `pw_feature.tmpl` appends `@llm-composed` block below deterministic
  scenarios
- Cyclomatic refactor: `probe.runAllImpl` 150 lines → 10 lines + 5
  named helpers

## v0.24 — taxonomy gaps closed (URL + diff)

- Diff-mode auto-detection wired (property / validator / cron /
  event / email)
- API expansions (idempotency / pagination / versioning when OpenAPI)
- Schema compatibility on PR diff (OpenAPI / proto / AsyncAPI) via
  `internal/compat`
- Templates for state / constructor / parameterized registered

## v0.23 — visual / GraphQL / webhook / gRPC

- Visual regression baselines via Playwright `toHaveScreenshot`
- GraphQL contracts via introspection
- Webhook signature tests (OpenAPI + provider-pattern detection)
- gRPC contracts from `.proto` diffs (per streaming shape)

## v0.22 — broader taxonomy

- a11y (@axe-core/playwright), responsive, perf, security headers,
  health probes, observability headers, OpenAPI contract,
  i18n, cross-browser

## v0.21 — Gherkin-first

- `.feature` files become executable contracts via playwright-bdd
- `.spec.ts` happy-flow emission dropped; step defs in
  `tests/e2e/steps/reviewqa.steps.ts`

## v0.20 — Achilles Tier 2

- API contract testing per `<form action>`
- Coverage modes: breadth / standard / depth
- Bug-discovery ledger (`tests/e2e/docs/findings.md`)

## v0.19 — Steps API + priorities + catalogue

- `tests/e2e/lib/steps.ts` higher-level helper verbs
- `@priority:critical|standard|nice-to-have` tags
- `tests/e2e/docs/test-catalogue.md` + `summary.html`
- `prompt --evidence` runs + ZIPs artifacts
- Browser-mode DOM snapshots under `tests/e2e/_dom/`
