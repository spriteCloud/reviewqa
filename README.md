OSS PR bot. A small Go binary + GitHub Action that watches a PR (or a live
URL), opens a follow-up PR with generated Playwright tests + stakeholder
docs, and heals broken locators when they drift.

> **Looking for the local UI, on-prem / data-sovereign deploy, or
> named SLA?** Those live in the commercial
> [`spriteCloud/quail`](https://github.com/spriteCloud/quail) edition.
> Both editions share the same engine; the OSS one ships the PR/CI
> surface only.
>
> **Migration notice (v1.0.0):** the repository was renamed from
> `spriteCloud/quail` to `spriteCloud/quail-review`. The action input
> `uses: spriteCloud/quail@v1` continues to work via GitHub's redirect
> for 30 days; please update to `spriteCloud/quail-review@v1` at your
> earliest convenience.

- **One binary**, pure Go, no CGO — works locally and in CI.
- **Deterministic-first**: regex/AST/HTML extractors emit test scaffolds the
  same way every time. LLM-composed Scenarios are an OPT-IN second layer.
- **10-layer taxonomy** out of the box: Unit, Component, API, Contract,
  Integration, Backend, UI, Mobile, Data, Non-functional. See
  [docs](https://spritecloud.github.io/quail-review/).
- **Inference is yours**: any OpenAI-compatible base URL (Ollama, vLLM,
  OpenAI).

## See it on real sites

Live output from the v1.0.0 binary is committed under [`examples/`](./examples/) — six reference probes (playwright.dev, gohugo.io, books.toscrape.com, es.wikipedia.org/Madrid, spritecloud.com, petstore.swagger.io). Each is a complete, runnable Playwright + Gherkin project. Full breakdown lives on the [product site](https://spritecloud.github.io/quail-review/).

## Tailor the generated suite locally (commercial)

The local browser UI lives in the **commercial** [`spriteCloud/quail`](https://github.com/spriteCloud/quail) edition. Same engine, plus the local-serve UI, on-prem / data-sovereign deploy paths, and named SLA. Contact hello@spritecloud.com.

## Quick start

```bash
# Probe a live URL — generate the matrix-of-everything against the
# pages the spider finds. No source code needed.
quail probe --url https://www.spritecloud.com
quail probe --url https://shop.example.com --coverage depth

# Focus on a specific journey kind via natural-language filter.
quail prompt "verify the checkout flow" --url https://shop.example.com
quail prompt "verify the contact form rejects bad emails" --url https://x.com --evidence

# Generate from a PR diff — fan changed source code into per-aspect tests.
quail generate --pr 42
quail scan --pr 42                                   # dry-run first

# Run the generated suite once locally; --record updates the bug ledger
# so the next probe emits a sentinel spec per failure.
quail run-once --record

# Repair broken Playwright locators on test failure.
quail heal --pr 42 --report playwright-report.json

# Merge fresh Playwright failures into tests/e2e/docs/findings.md by hand.
quail ledger update --report playwright-report.json
```

## The 10-layer taxonomy

Every test quail emits maps to one of ten layers. Six of them
auto-emit on any live-URL probe; the other four trigger from PR-diff
source code.

| # | Layer | How it emits | Per-emit depth |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | Unit | PR diff adds a function/method | 1+ per symbol |
| 2 | Component | PR diff touches a Kind=Component symbol | 3–5 |
| 3 | API | HTML form OR OpenAPI endpoint | **10 per form** (1 happy + 9 negatives) |
| 4 | Contract | OpenAPI/GraphQL/Webhook discovered OR always-attempt stubs | **9 per endpoint** |
| 5 | Integration | Always-on scaffold (5 stubs × 3 blocks) + real Testcontainers via `quail.yml` | 15 per origin |
| 6 | Backend | PR diff touches gRPC source | 1+ per method |
| 7 | UI | Every probed page (a11y trio is uncapped) | a11y/landmarks/keyboard 5 each per page; rest ~1–3 |
| 8 | Mobile | Every probed page (capped) | **8 per page** (4 devices × 2 orientations) |
| 9 | Data | PR diff touches dbt / pandera / Great-Expectations | 1+ per schema |
| 10 | Non-functional | Every probed page (mix of capped and uncapped) | ~17 templates, 1–3 tests each |

## Subcommands

## Environment

The full set; every var is read from the environment AND most have a CLI flag.

### LLM composer (opt-in)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_LLM` | (empty) | OpenAI-compatible endpoint. When set, the composer adds up to 5 `@llm-composed` Scenarios per journey. **Strictly local-only** — never set in public CI. |
| `QUAIL_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model id. Auto-set to `qwen3-coder-next:latest` when `--llm` points at an Ollama-shaped endpoint. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_LADDER` | (empty) | Comma-separated model fallbacks. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `60s` *(since v0.48)* | Per-call timeout. Bump on slower local LLMs. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_TOKEN_CAP` | `600` | Max output tokens per LLM call. |
| `QUAIL_HUMANIZE` | (unset) | Set to `0` to skip per-file humanization while keeping composer active. |
| `QUAIL_ALLOW_DIFF_TO_LLM` | `0` | Send PR diff to LLM; off by default. |
| `QUAIL_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` | `/graphql` | Override stub introspection path. |
| `QUAIL_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` | (empty) | Webhook receiver path to activate signed-POST checks. |
| `QUAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (empty) | HMAC signing secret. |

### Probe / spider

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_TARGET_URLS` | — | Comma-separated URLs to probe (alternative to `--url`). |
| `QUAIL_COVERAGE` | `standard` | `breadth` (8/2) · `standard` (30/3) · `depth` (75/5) · `max` (120/5). |
| `QUAIL_BROWSER_PROBE` | (unset) | Set to `1` to drive Chromium (Playwright) instead of static HTML crawl. Required for SPAs. |
| `QUAIL_IGNORE_ROBOTS` | (unset) | Set to `1` to crawl `robots.txt` Disallow paths. Default OFF; enable for QA of sites you own. |
| `QUAIL_PROBE_ALLOW_LOOPBACK` | (unset) | `1` to bypass loopback/private-IP guard (tests only). |

### CI / PR plumbing

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `QUAIL_GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | API auth |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | from event | `owner/name` |
| `QUAIL_PR` | from event | PR number override |
| `QUAIL_BRANCH_PREFIX` | `quail` | Branch prefix for generated PRs |
| `QUAIL_WORKDIR` | `.` | Repo working dir |
| `QUAIL_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |

### Healing + framework conventions

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_HEAL_MODE` | `on-failure` | `on-failure` \| `proactive` \| `off` |
| `QUAIL_PLAYWRIGHT_REPORT` | `playwright-report.json` | Report path |
| `QUAIL_E2E_STYLE` | `auto` | `auto` · `per-component` · `page-flow` |
| `QUAIL_PAGE_URLS` | — | JSON map of `{"source/path.tsx": "/route"}` for bespoke routing |

## Use in a workflow

```yaml
name: quail
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  quail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: spriteCloud/quail-review@v1
        with:
          # Optional — leave empty to skip the LLM humanizer entirely.
          openai-base-url: ${{ vars.QUAIL_LLM_URL }}
          openai-api-key:  ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          model: qwen3-coder-next:latest
          heal-mode: on-failure
```

### Probe-only mode (no diff needed)

Drop this into `.github/workflows/quail-probe.yml` of any repo to generate
Playwright tests against a live URL — no source code required:

```yaml
name: quail-probe
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      url:
        description: URL to probe
        required: true
        default: https://example.com
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  probe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: spriteCloud/quail-review@v1
        with:
          target-urls: ${{ github.event.inputs.url }}
          run-generate: 'false'
          run-heal: 'false'
```

## AI usage rules

The LLM is allowed to do exactly two things:

1. **Humanize**: rewrite strings inside a deterministic test file so titles
   and step comments read like a human wrote them. The rewritten file is
   structure-checked against the original (same imports, same number of
   `describe`/`it`/`test`) and falls back to the deterministic output on
   any mismatch.
2. **Compose** (opt-in via `QUAIL_LLM`): propose up to 5 additional
   Gherkin Scenarios per journey, drawn ONLY from a registered step-pattern
   vocabulary. Invalid scenarios are dropped before the template renders.

The PR diff is **never** sent to the LLM unless `QUAIL_ALLOW_DIFF_TO_LLM=1`.
