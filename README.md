A small Go binary + GitHub Action that watches a PR (or a live URL), opens a
follow-up PR with generated Playwright tests + stakeholder docs, and heals
broken locators when they drift.

- **One binary**, pure Go, no CGO — works locally and in CI.
- **Deterministic-first**: regex/AST/HTML extractors emit test scaffolds the
  same way every time. LLM-composed Scenarios are an OPT-IN second layer.
- **10-layer taxonomy** out of the box: Unit, Component, API, Contract,
  Integration, Backend, UI, Mobile, Data, Non-functional. See [docs](https://spritecloud.github.io/quail/docs.html).
- **Inference is yours**: any OpenAI-compatible base URL (Ollama, vLLM,
  DGX-hosted vLLM, OpenAI).

## See it on real sites

Live output from the **v0.83 binary** is committed under [`examples/`](./examples/).
Six reference probes covering a spread of site shapes; each is a complete,
runnable Playwright + Gherkin project. Re-emit on every release via
[`scripts/refresh-examples.sh`](./scripts/refresh-examples.sh).

## Tailor the generated suite locally

`quail serve` opens a local browser UI for browsing AND editing the
Features, Scenarios, and stakeholder docs of an existing project. As of
v0.66 you can delete, edit, and append Scenarios from the UI; each edit
is backed up under `tests/e2e/.quail-history/`. v0.67 adds a 🔍 suggest
button on each step — probe a destination URL and the UI ranks candidate
Playwright locators against your hint. v0.68 wires an **AI compose**
button into the editor: type free Gherkin, set a destination URL, and
the LLM returns a Scenario whose steps match the registered patterns and
whose assertions reference the real DOM. v0.69 ports the public site's
full design system. v0.70 ships a **💬 Chat** button per Scenario — a
non-technical reviewer can talk to the LLM about that specific Scenario
and Apply the assistant's proposed update with one click.

**What's new since v0.70:**

- **v0.71 / v0.75** — ▶ Run button per Scenario streams Playwright
  output as Server-Sent Events; per-step verdicts post-parsed from
  the JSON reporter; last-run pill persists across reloads.
- **v0.76 — HOME view + probe from the UI.** Sidebar opens on a HOME
  panel with a Probe form that shells out to `quail probe --local`
  (no GitHub token needed) and streams stdout into a terminal panel.
  Project list auto-refreshes on success.
- **v0.77 — Settings page.** Edits persist to
  `~/.config/quail/serve.json` (mode 0600) and take effect on the
  next API call. Toggle LLM on/off, set endpoint / model / API key /
  timeout (with a Test-connection button), set probe + run defaults.
- **v0.78 — Project switcher + Stakeholder Summary rewrite + history.**
  The header pill is now a dropdown that lists sibling quail
  projects, plus a recents list and a free-form "Open path" input.
  Each probe writes timestamped copies to `tests/e2e/docs/history/`.
- **v0.79.1 — UI verbosity sweep + dropped redundant PRETTY/RAW toggle.**
- **v0.80 — Onboard non-quail projects + vanilla Playwright.**
  The switcher accepts any directory with a `playwright.config.{ts,js}`
  or a `*.spec.{ts,js}` under `tests/`, `e2e/`, `playwright/`. A new
  `Tests` sidebar section surfaces vanilla `test('…')` blocks alongside
  Gherkin Scenarios.
- **v0.81 — Probe-into-new-project.** Probing a fresh URL from the
  HOME form now creates a sibling project dir named after the URL's
  brand and auto-switches into it on success.
- **v0.82 — Multi-run history + sparkline.** The last-run pill is now
  clickable; opens an SVG sparkline of the last 20 runs plus the most
  recent 5 as a list.
- **v0.83 — Design tokens + responsive polish.** Status colors
  centralized, narrower-viewport rules tightened.

| Example | Site | Files | Pages w/ a11y | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| [`playwright-dev/`](./examples/playwright-dev/) | <https://playwright.dev> | **183** | 30 | SaaS-shaped docs, JS-heavy |
| [`gohugo-io/`](./examples/gohugo-io/) | <https://gohugo.io> | **196** | 30 | OSS marketing + content |
| [`books-toscrape-com/`](./examples/books-toscrape-com/) | <https://books.toscrape.com> | **186** | 30 | E-commerce list-and-detail |
| [`es-wikipedia-org-madrid/`](./examples/es-wikipedia-org-madrid/) | <https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid> | **201** | 30 | Non-English content page |
| [`spritecloud-com-dgx/`](./examples/spritecloud-com-dgx/) | <https://www.spritecloud.com> | **197** | 30 | Marketing + lead-gen, **LLM composer ON** |
| [`petstore-swagger-io-dgx/`](./examples/petstore-swagger-io-dgx/) | <https://petstore3.swagger.io> | **46** | 1 | API service exposing OpenAPI 3 — **lights up Contract layer with 12 specs × 9 tests each** |

Every example exercises the full template family: a11y trio
(uncapped) + responsive + perf + visual + visual-states + security + health +
observability + i18n + mobile (4 devices × 2 orientations) + network +
storage + zoom + prefs + print + history-depth + touch + auth-expiry +
integration stubs (api / db / cache / obs / auth) + graphql/webhook stubs.

Layer 4 (Contract) needs an OpenAPI / GraphQL / Webhook surface to populate
beyond the stubs — that's why **petstore-swagger-io-dgx** is the demo:
12 contract specs auto-derived from petstore's OpenAPI 3 doc, each with
9 tests (1 happy + 8 adversarial negatives — wrong-method, oversized-query,
invalid-json, unicode, sqli, xss, null-byte, rapid-burst). The other 5
sites have no schema surface so they get the always-attempt stubs only.

## Quick start

```bash
# Probe a live URL — generate the matrix-of-everything against the
# pages the spider finds. No source code needed.
quail probe --url https://www.spritecloud.com
quail probe --url https://shop.example.com --coverage depth

# Focus on a specific journey kind via natural-language filter.
quail prompt "verify the checkout flow" --url https://shop.example.com
quail prompt "verify the contact form rejects bad emails" --url https://x.com --evidence

# Generate from a PR diff — fan changed source code into per-aspect tests.
quail generate --pr 42
quail scan --pr 42                                   # dry-run first

# Run the generated suite once locally; --record updates the bug ledger
# so the next probe emits a sentinel spec per failure.
quail run-once --record

# Repair broken Playwright locators on test failure.
quail heal --pr 42 --report playwright-report.json

# Merge fresh Playwright failures into tests/e2e/docs/findings.md by hand.
quail ledger update --report playwright-report.json
```

## The 10-layer taxonomy

Every test quail emits maps to one of ten layers. Six of them
auto-emit on any live-URL probe; the other four trigger from PR-diff
source code.

| # | Layer | How it emits | Per-emit depth |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | Unit | PR diff adds a function/method | 1+ per symbol |
| 2 | Component | PR diff touches a Kind=Component symbol | 3–5 |
| 3 | API | HTML form OR OpenAPI endpoint | **10 per form** (1 happy + 9 negatives) |
| 4 | Contract | OpenAPI/GraphQL/Webhook discovered OR always-attempt stubs | **9 per endpoint** |
| 5 | Integration | Always-on scaffold (5 stubs × 3 blocks) + real Testcontainers via `quail.yml` | 15 per origin |
| 6 | Backend | PR diff touches gRPC source | 1+ per method |
| 7 | UI | Every probed page (a11y trio is uncapped) | a11y/landmarks/keyboard 5 each per page; rest ~1–3 |
| 8 | Mobile | Every probed page (capped) | **8 per page** (4 devices × 2 orientations) |
| 9 | Data | PR diff touches dbt / pandera / Great-Expectations | 1+ per schema |
| 10 | Non-functional | Every probed page (mix of capped and uncapped) | ~17 templates, 1–3 tests each |

## Environment

The full set; every var is read from the environment AND most have a CLI flag.

### LLM composer (opt-in)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_LLM` | (empty) | OpenAI-compatible endpoint. When set, the composer adds up to 5 `@llm-composed` Scenarios per journey. **Strictly local-only** — never set in public CI. |
| `QUAIL_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model id. Auto-set to `qwen3-coder-next:latest` when `--llm` points at an Ollama-shaped endpoint. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_LADDER` | (empty) | Comma-separated model fallbacks. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `60s` *(since v0.48)* | Per-call timeout. Bump on slower local LLMs. |
| `QUAIL_LLM_TOKEN_CAP` | `600` | Max output tokens per LLM call. |
| `QUAIL_HUMANIZE` | (unset) | Set to `0` to skip per-file humanization while keeping composer active. |
| `QUAIL_ALLOW_DIFF_TO_LLM` | `0` | Send PR diff to LLM; off by default. |
| `QUAIL_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` | `/graphql` | Override stub introspection path. |
| `QUAIL_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` | (empty) | Webhook receiver path to activate signed-POST checks. |
| `QUAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (empty) | HMAC signing secret. |

### Probe / spider

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_TARGET_URLS` | — | Comma-separated URLs to probe (alternative to `--url`). |
| `QUAIL_COVERAGE` | `standard` | `breadth` (8/2) · `standard` (30/3) · `depth` (75/5) · `max` (120/5). |
| `QUAIL_BROWSER_PROBE` | (unset) | Set to `1` to drive Chromium (Playwright) instead of static HTML crawl. Required for SPAs. |
| `QUAIL_IGNORE_ROBOTS` | (unset) | Set to `1` to crawl `robots.txt` Disallow paths. Default OFF; enable for QA of sites you own. |
| `QUAIL_PROBE_ALLOW_LOOPBACK` | (unset) | `1` to bypass loopback/private-IP guard (tests only). |

### CI / PR plumbing

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `QUAIL_GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | API auth |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | from event | `owner/name` |
| `QUAIL_PR` | from event | PR number override |
| `QUAIL_BRANCH_PREFIX` | `quail` | Branch prefix for generated PRs |
| `QUAIL_WORKDIR` | `.` | Repo working dir |
| `QUAIL_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |

### Healing + framework conventions

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUAIL_HEAL_MODE` | `on-failure` | `on-failure` \| `proactive` \| `off` |
| `QUAIL_PLAYWRIGHT_REPORT` | `playwright-report.json` | Report path |
| `QUAIL_E2E_STYLE` | `auto` | `auto` · `per-component` · `page-flow` |
| `QUAIL_PAGE_URLS` | — | JSON map of `{"source/path.tsx": "/route"}` for bespoke routing |

## Use in a workflow

```yaml
name: quail
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  quail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: spriteCloud/quail@v1
        with:
          # Optional — leave empty to skip the LLM humanizer entirely.
          openai-base-url: ${{ vars.QUAIL_LLM_URL }}

          heal-mode: on-failure
```

### Probe-only mode (no diff needed)

Drop this into `.github/workflows/quail-probe.yml` of any repo to generate
Playwright tests against a live URL — no source code required:

```yaml
name: quail-probe
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      url:
        description: URL to probe
        required: true
        default: https://example.com
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  probe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: spriteCloud/quail@v1
        with:
          target-urls: ${{ github.event.inputs.url }}
          run-generate: 'false'
          run-heal: 'false'
```

## AI usage rules

The LLM is allowed to do exactly two things:

1. **Humanize**: rewrite strings inside a deterministic test file so titles
   and step comments read like a human wrote them. The rewritten file is
   structure-checked against the original (same imports, same number of
   `describe`/`it`/`test`) and falls back to the deterministic output on
   any mismatch.
2. **Compose** (opt-in via `QUAIL_LLM`): propose up to 5 additional
   Gherkin Scenarios per journey, drawn ONLY from a registered step-pattern
   vocabulary. Invalid scenarios are dropped before the template renders.

The PR diff is **never** sent to the LLM unless `QUAIL_ALLOW_DIFF_TO_LLM=1`.
